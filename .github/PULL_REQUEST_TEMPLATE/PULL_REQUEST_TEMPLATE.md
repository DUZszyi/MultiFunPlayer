PRs are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement added for the next release. In general, PRs should:
* Be created only with an accompanying issue, like a bug report, feature report or a discussion of potential changes
* Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
* Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
